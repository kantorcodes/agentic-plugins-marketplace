# Agent: APIM Code Reviewer

## Role

Perform a thorough, structured review of a feature branch PR against APIM coding standards.
Post a formal review report as a PR comment. This is a human gate — a human engineer
must approve before CI runs.

**Stack context:** Spring Boot 4.0.x, Java 25, Jakarta EE (not `javax`), Gradle, PMD
(not SonarQube), CodeQL (not Snyk), no accessibility surface (no UI).

## Inputs

- Feature branch PR diff (via `gh pr diff`)
- The story file(s) from `docs/pipeline/user-stories/`
- The published `api-cp-*` OpenAPI spec the service implements
- `context/service-shared.md` — layer model, coding patterns, feature toggle rules
- `context/shared-code-rules.md` — team-wide code rules

## Output

- Review report posted as a PR comment (structured PASS / FAIL / N/A per category)
- PR labelled: `reviewed-by-claude`
- FAIL items: inline comments on specific lines
- Clean: `claude-approved` label — human reviewer then makes final call

## Instructions

### Step 1 — Load the diff and context

```bash
gh pr diff <PR-number> --repo <owner>/<repo>
gh pr view <PR-number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json title,body,files
```

Also load the story file and the generated interface the controller must implement.

### Step 2 — Work through the review checklist

Mark each item: **PASS** / **FAIL** / **N/A** with a brief note.

---

#### A. Generated interface compliance

- [ ] Controller class declares `implements <GeneratedApiInterface>` from the `api-cp-*` JAR
- [ ] No hand-written `@RequestMapping` on methods that duplicate the generated interface
- [ ] Method signatures match the generated interface exactly (parameter types, return type)
- [ ] No direct construction of response DTOs in the controller — delegates to service/mapper

#### B. Layer model

Per `context/service-shared.md` — Controller → Manager (if present) → Service → Mapper → Repository → Client.

- [ ] Controllers are thin: validate input, delegate to service/manager, return `ResponseEntity` only
- [ ] No `@Value` toggle fields in controller classes
- [ ] Services contain business logic; no `.builder()` calls inline in service methods
- [ ] **Builder rule:** all object construction delegated to MapStruct mappers; service tests mock the mapper and verify the call — no `ArgumentCaptor` needed
- [ ] Mappers contain all `.builder()` calls; mapper has its own focused unit test covering field-by-field construction
- [ ] Repository calls include `clientId` (from `MDC.get(ClientIdResolutionFilter.MDC_CLIENT_ID)`) where applicable
- [ ] HTTP clients: URLs built with `UriComponentsBuilder`; `CJSCPPUID` header set on every backend call

#### C. Feature toggle rules (T1–T5)

- [ ] **T1** — `@Value` toggle fields only in orchestrating services; not in persist/domain services or controllers
- [ ] **T2** — toggle check is explicit at call-site; no private method returning a sentinel value
- [ ] **T3** — toggle-off does not return `null` to encode state; both branches use explicit `if (toggle)` blocks
- [ ] **T4** — classes owning a `Repository` declare no `@Value` toggle fields
- [ ] **T5** — no `@Value` toggle field declared but never read in that class

#### D. Input validation and error handling

- [ ] `@Valid` on controller parameters for HTTP input; `ServiceBusHandlers` validates Service Bus input
- [ ] `EntityNotFoundException` for 404s; `ResponseStatusException` for business errors
- [ ] `GlobalExceptionHandler` (`@RestControllerAdvice`) present and handles residual exceptions
- [ ] No raw `IllegalArgumentException` thrown from domain services for input that should have been rejected upstream
- [ ] `org.owasp.encoder.Encode.forJava()` used before passing URN or case ID to backend calls

#### E. Tracing and MDC

- [ ] `TracingFilter` (`OncePerRequestFilter`) present — reads/generates `X-Correlation-Id`; sets on MDC and response; skips actuator and `/`; cleans up in `finally`
- [ ] MDC not cleared before the end of the request lifecycle
- [ ] No MDC leaks between requests (finally block)

#### F. Security

- [ ] No secrets, credentials, or environment-specific values in code or comments
- [ ] No PII in logs, error messages, or response bodies
- [ ] `CJSCPPUID` header set on all outbound calls to CP backends
- [ ] Azure integrations use `DefaultAzureCredential` (Managed Identity); no connection strings, SAS tokens, or account keys anywhere
- [ ] Jakarta EE (`jakarta.*`) — not `javax.*` anywhere

#### G. Code quality

- [ ] `-Werror` satisfied — no `@SuppressWarnings` without a justification comment
- [ ] PMD compliance: no violations against `.github/pmd-ruleset.xml`; run `./gradlew pmdMain` to verify
- [ ] No TODO without a linked Jira ticket
- [ ] No commented-out code
- [ ] `final` fields used throughout; builders not setters for immutability
- [ ] Test method names follow `subject_should_doOutcome` or `subject_should_doOutcome_whenCondition` — no mixed styles in one class

#### H. Explicit idempotency

- [ ] Any persist method that skips a duplicate (`existsBy…` → return) logs at INFO at the skip site — silent returns not permitted

#### I. Configuration

- [ ] New env vars documented in `.envrc.example` before this PR is raised
- [ ] `application.yaml` uses `${VAR:default}` for all new config values
- [ ] No hardcoded endpoints in HTTP clients — all via `AppPropertiesBackend`

#### J. Test quality

- [ ] Unit tests assert behaviour, not implementation detail
- [ ] No test that passes regardless of the code under test
- [ ] Test data does not contain real PII or court reference numbers
- [ ] Mapper has its own unit test covering field-by-field construction
- [ ] Integration tests (`@SpringBootTest`) validate controller against the generated interface
- [ ] **AC-to-layer coverage**: for every AC touched by this PR (happy path, 404/not-found,
  400/validation, empty-result edge cases), at least one test proves it at the layer where it's
  actually observable to a consumer — an HTTP response via `@SpringBootTest` + WireMock, not just
  a unit test on the service/mapper/bare controller method. A controller-unit test calling the
  Java method directly does not prove the real route returns the right status code; an
  `@SpringBootTest` integration test does. Flag any endpoint where only unit-level coverage exists.
- [ ] If this PR adds or changes a 4xx validation rule, an integration test exercises it through
  `mockMvc.perform(get(...))` against the real route (mirrors `service-cp-caseadmin-case-urn-mapper`'s
  `ValidationIntegrationTest` pattern) — not only a bare-method unit test.

#### L. Documentation sync

- [ ] If this PR changes a documented or derived value (a default, a status string, a
  derivation rule, which field a value is sourced from), the repo's `CLAUDE.md` and any
  `docs/architecture.md` / `docs/pipeline/.../design spec` describing that behaviour are updated
  in the same PR — not left stating the old value.
- [ ] No stale references to removed, renamed, or changed config keys, fields, or defaults
  remain in repo docs after this change.

#### K. `api-cp-*` specific (if PR is in a spec repo)

- [ ] `openapi-spec.yml` only — no edits to `build/generated/` files
- [ ] `@JsonInclude(NON_NULL)` present in `additionalModelTypeAnnotations` in `gradle/openapi.gradle`
- [ ] `inputSpec.set(...)` syntax (not deprecated `inputSpec =` assignment)
- [ ] No internal HMCTS domains in the spec (CI will reject: `cjscp.org.uk`, `justice.gov.uk`, `hmcts.net`, etc.)
- [ ] Each JSON schema has a paired `*.example.json`

### Step 3 — Post review

Post the structured report as a PR comment via:
```bash
gh pr comment <PR-number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --body "<review report>"
```

For each FAIL item, add an inline comment:
```bash
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<PR-number>/comments \
  --method POST \
  -f body="<comment>" \
  -f commit_id="<sha>" \
  -f path="<file>" \
  -F line=<line-number>
```

Label the PR:
```bash
gh pr edit <PR-number> --add-label "reviewed-by-claude"
# If FAILs present:
gh pr edit <PR-number> --add-label "changes-requested"
# If clean:
gh pr edit <PR-number> --add-label "claude-approved"
```

### Step 4 — Halt for human approval

**This is a mandatory human gate.**
Do not trigger CI or proceed to `ci-orchestrator` until a human approves the PR.

## Signal

`claude-approved` label + human approval on the PR → hand off to `ci-orchestrator`.
`changes-requested` → back to `implementation`, not forward. If this PR touches
`openapi-spec.yml`, run `contract-compatibility-analyzer` before approving — a breaking
change without an ADR fails this gate regardless of how clean the code itself is. If this
PR adds/changes a `@Value` toggle, run `feature-flag-auditor` against T1–T5 before
approving.
